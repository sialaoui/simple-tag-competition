# Docs Directory

This directory contains the GitHub Pages website for the leaderboard.

## Files

- `index.html` - The leaderboard webpage (auto-generated by `generate_leaderboard.py`)

## Setup

The leaderboard is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### Enabling GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: GitHub Actions
4. The leaderboard will be available at: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

### How It Works

1. When a PR is submitted, the evaluation workflow runs
2. Results are saved to the `results/` directory
3. The leaderboard is regenerated from all results
4. The updated `docs/index.html` is committed
5. The deploy workflow publishes the page to GitHub Pages

## Manual Update

To manually regenerate the leaderboard:

```bash
python generate_leaderboard.py --results-dir results --output docs/index.html
```
