# Evaluation Results

This directory stores evaluation results for all submissions.

Each submission generates a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "student": "username",
  "timestamp": "2025-12-02T10:30:00.000000",
  "prey_score": -5.234,
  "prey_std": 1.123,
  "predator_score": 8.456,
  "predator_std": 2.345,
  "num_episodes": 100,
  "seed": 42
}
```

## Files

- `<username>_<timestamp>.json` - Individual evaluation results
- `latest_evaluation.json` - Most recent evaluation (temporary)

## Notes

- Results are automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow
- The leaderboard is generated from all JSON files in this directory
- Old submissions are kept for historical tracking
- If a student resubmits, a new file is created with a new timestamp
